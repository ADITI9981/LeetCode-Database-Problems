Table: Employees

+----------------+---------+
| Column Name    | Type    | 
+----------------+---------+
| employee_id    | int     |
| employee_name  | varchar |
| manager_id     | int     |
| salary         | int     |
| department     | varchar |
+----------------+----------+
employee_id is the unique key for this table.
Each row contains information about an employee, including their ID, name, their manager's ID, salary, and department.
manager_id is null for the top-level manager (CEO).
Write a solution to analyze the organizational hierarchy and answer the following:

Hierarchy Levels: For each employee, determine their level in the organization (CEO is level 1, employees reporting directly to the CEO are level 2, and so on).
Team Size: For each employee who is a manager, count the total number of employees under them (direct and indirect reports).
Salary Budget: For each manager, calculate the total salary budget they control (sum of salaries of all employees under them, including indirect reports, plus their own salary).
Return the result table ordered by the result ordered by level in ascending order, then by budget in descending order, and finally by employee_name in ascending order.

The result format is in the following example.
